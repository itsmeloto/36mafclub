## ✨ Major Improvements

### 1. **Design System Enhancement**
- **Consistent Glass-morphism**: Created reusable `.glass-card` and `.glass-card-light` utility classes for unified backdrop-blur effects
- **Standardized Button Styles**: Implemented `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, and `.btn-ghost` classes for consistency
- **Unified Gradients**: Standardized heading gradients with `.heading-gradient` class
- **Touch-friendly Targets**: Added `.touch-target` class ensuring minimum 44px × 44px interactive elements for better mobile UX

### 2. **Responsive Typography**
- **Fluid Sizing**: Implemented `clamp()` for responsive text that scales smoothly across all devices
  - Headings: `clamp(1.875rem, 4vw, 2.5rem)` - scales between 30px and 40px
  - Body text: `clamp(0.875rem, 2vw, 1rem)` - scales between 14px and 16px
  - Large titles: `clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3.5rem)` - scales between 32px and 56px
- **Improved Legibility**: Enhanced Armenian text rendering with better letter spacing and font smoothing

### 3. **Enhanced Animations**
Added smooth, performant animations throughout:
- `.animate-fade-in` - Refined fade-in with slide-up effect (0.8s)
- `.animate-fade-in-slow` - Delayed entrance animations (1.5s)
- `.animate-fade-in-fast` - Quick transitions (0.4s)
- `.animate-slide-in-up` - Upward sliding entrance (0.6s)
- `.animate-scale-in` - Bouncy scale entrance with spring effect (0.5s)
- `.animate-pulse-glow` - Subtle continuous pulsing for important elements

### 4. **Accessibility Improvements**
- **Focus States**: Added visible focus rings on all interactive elements with proper contrast
- **ARIA Labels**: Added descriptive labels to all buttons for screen readers
- **Touch Targets**: Ensured all clickable elements meet minimum size requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced focus styles for better keyboard accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: Improved text contrast (changed gray-300 to gray-200 in many places)

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Smooth Transitions**: Centralized `.smooth-transition` utility for consistent 300ms transitions
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Used `transform` and `opacity` for GPU-accelerated animations
- **Reduced Layout Shifts**: Fixed spacing and sizing to prevent cumulative layout shift (CLS)
- **Optimized Re-renders**: Maintained component structure while improving visual feedback
